This portfolio highlights my skills in Python, C++, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and expertise in machine learning and data analysis with TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. It features sections for skills, certifications, and projects, with interactive elements like hover effects and links. The design is responsive and hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access.
